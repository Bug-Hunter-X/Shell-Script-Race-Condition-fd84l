This repository demonstrates a race condition bug in a shell script.  The script launches two background processes that write to separate files concurrently. The final output of the script is non-deterministic and depends on the order in which the operating system schedules the processes. This showcases a common issue in parallel programming in shell scripts which can lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior if not carefully handled. The solution demonstrates how to use proper synchronization mechanisms such as `flock` to prevent such race conditions.
